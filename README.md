## üí° How to Get Better Results

This application uses the **DALL-E 2** model from OpenAI to generate images. The quality of the generated character depends heavily on the prompt you provide. Here are some tips for writing effective prompts:

*   **Be Specific:** Instead of "a warrior", try "a female knight with silver armor, holding a glowing sword".
*   **Describe the Style:** You can influence the art style. For example, add "in the style of a 90s anime" or "with a modern, clean art style".
*   **Include Details:** Mention colors, clothing, accessories, and expressions. For example, "a cheerful mage with a blue robe and a wooden staff, smiling".
*   **Set the Scene:** While the prompt adds a simple background by default, you can specify elements like "standing in a forest" or "with a futuristic city in the background".

The application will combine your prompt with a base instruction to create a detailed anime character. Experiment with different descriptions to see what you can create!
